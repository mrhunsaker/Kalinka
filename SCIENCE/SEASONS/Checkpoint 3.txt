#3 Review and Discuss
e
For Checkpoint 3, we will review what we learned in Checkpoint 1 and 2 from the 3D model we used in class, the videos in Day 2, and the direct-indirect lab. We will draw on paper a model of the Sun showing the Earth's seasons. To pass off Checkpoint 3, please take pictures of your completed model and paste it into the Checkpoint.  

While this project is not an art project, I will be tough on requiring that all information is detailed and accurately shown.  

Your model must include the following. 
· Sun
· Earth x4
· Equator x4
· Axis x4
· Degree of tilt x4
· Sunbeams x4 heading at each Earth correct to the lean and the season indicated.
· Season label

Once you have your model accurately detailed, photographed, and uploaded DO NOT lose your model. You will be adding to it. After your upload, and you have Day 1 and 2 submitted for review, research the Solstices and the Equinoxes – I suggest taking notes.
