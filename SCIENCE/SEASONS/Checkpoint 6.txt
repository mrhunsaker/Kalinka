    Read the Description for the 3D Final Product. 
	
	On your days off from school next week, you will be working on this assignment for science. Please grab any supplies from school if needed to complete the assignment. 
    Assignment: Research and write down ideas on what you could do to create your 3-dimensional model. Take a picture of your notes/ideas and paste them into Checkpoint #6.
    Start collecting items. Take a picture of your collected items and paste them under your notes in Checkpoint #6. I only want pictures of your progress for right now - I do not expect the product to be done until the end of next week. 

I will give you a week to complete your 3D project from home. 
Be creative!
