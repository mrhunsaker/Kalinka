Create a 3D model of the sun and Earth in its four seasons. To receive a "Green" please refer to the guidelines in the Description below.

The sky is the limit (no pun intended) on what supplies you may use to create a 3D model to prove you understand why the Earth experiences different seasons. Please take a picture of your 3D object and paste it into your Final Product for credit. Then, bring your model to school for display. 
For full credit, please have the following items on your model:
-Sun
-4 Earths placed around the sun in 90 degree angles with the correct tilt
-Label each Earth with what season it is experiencing at the different 90 degree angles
-Labels indicating what position the Earth is in during solstice and equinoxes including dates
-Arrows indicating Earth's revolution around the sun
-Points will also be given for quality of work
