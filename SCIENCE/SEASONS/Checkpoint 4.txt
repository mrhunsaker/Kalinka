Checkpoint 4

Every season has either an Equinox or a Solstice. In Day 3, I told you what you needed to correctly show me in your educational poster so that I knew you had mastery. For day 4, you will research both Equinox and Solstice. Then you will decide how you will demonstrate showing mastery in understanding each season Equinox or Solstice. Remember, this is you showing that you have MASTERED understanding of Equinox and Solstice. Not a race to say, "I'm done!"

This is what I will be grading on and looking to see that you have mastery.

What is an Equinox?
What is a Solstice?
What seasons are they associated with?
What are the dates for each?
Is there a "wing" attachment for the main educational poster for each Equinox or Solstice? Or is it properly linked on the poster itself if you put it on the poster?

Take pictures of what you have done for Equinox and Solstice and insert them at the bottom. Don't lose them. We will be attaching them to the poster. 

When finished. Watch the Bill Nye videos below.
