Part 1 of your two-part final for Seasons.

Everyone will receive the following components.
4 gumballs of various colors to represent Earth.
1 Yellow gumball to represent the sun.
1 Styrofoam square
5 toothpicks
Access to various colored narrow tipped Sharpies. DO NOT SMASH THE MARKERS!
 
Instructions 

Showing What You Know, does not always have to be painful. Today, I want you to have some fun and build a model showing me what you know about the seasons. Sharpies are for making your equators. Before marking your equator, take note of where the hole is drilled into the gumball for putting it on your toothpick prior to sticking the toothpick into your piece of Styrofoam. 

Suggestion: 1. Peel the plastic and foil covers off your Styrofoam. It peels cleanly off. 2. Give the Sharpie a moment to dry before touching the Sharpie marks on the gumball so they do not smudge.

Grading 
What I will be looking for isâ€¦
Equators
Positioning of the Earths around the Sun.
Tilt being shown and represented by how you draw your equator.
Visually indicated direction of revolution drawn on the Styrofoam. An arrow.
Season written beneath the gumball (written on the Styrofoam)
Equinox or Solstice written below the gumball for that season. 
Do not forget to put your name on it. 
 
When finished, upload a picture of your model.
